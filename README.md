PART A : Implement the following using C/C++ :
1. Write a program to transfer the contents of a requested file from server to the client using TCP/IP
  Sockets (using TCP/IP Socketprogramming).
  
2. Write a program to archive Traffic management at Flow level by implementing Closed Loop Control
   technique. (Leaky BucketAlgorithm)
  
3. Write a program to implement dynamic routing strategy in finding optimal path for data transmission.
  (Bellman fordalgorithm).
  
4. Write a program to implement Link State Routing (DijkstraAlgorithm).

5. Write a program for implementing the error detection technique while data transfer in unreliable
   network code using CRC (16-bits)Technique.

6. Write a program for providing security for transfer of data in the network. (RSAAlgorithm)

7. Write a program for encrypting 64 bit playing text using DESalgorithm.

PART B: Simulation Programs using OPNET /NS2 or any other equivalent software
1. Simulate a 3 node point to point network with duplex links between them. Set the Queue size
   andvary the bandwidth and find the number of packetsdropped.

2. Simulate a four-node point-to-point network, and connect the links as follows: n0->n2, n1->n2 and
   n2->n3. Apply TCP agent changing the parameters and determine the number of packets
   sent/received by TCP/UDP

3. Simulate the different types of internet traffic such as FTP and TELNET over network and analyze
   the throughput.
